# WaterConsumptionAnalysis

Quantitative data and code for an analysis of water consumption in Indianapolis, Indiana at the census tract level. The results from the analysis are currently under review:

Obringer, R., Nateghi, R., Ma, Z., and Kumar, R. A socio-environmental approach for modeling intra-city water consumption.

The code was developed in R version 4.0.2 and last ran on 30 September 2021. The code can be found in waterconsumptionanalysis.R and the associated Rdata files can be found in the 'rdatafiles' folder. To run the R code, make sure to update the directories with locations on your personal device. Each section can be run individually, if one uploads the Rdata files beforehand, otherwise, the sections should be run sequentially.

Three categories of data were collected: demographic data, climate data, and water consumption data, which can be found in the 'InputData' folder. All data were collected in 2019.

Census tract shapefiles can be found in the 'CensusTracts' folder.
