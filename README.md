Quantitative data and code for an analysis of water consumption in Indianapolis, Indiana at the census tract level. The results from the analysis are currently under review:

Obringer, R., Nateghi, R., Ma, Z., and Kumar, R. A socio-environmental approach for modeling intra-city water consumption.

The code was developed in R version 4.0.2 and last ran on 29 September 2021. The code can be found in waterconsumptionanalysis.R and the associated Rdata files can be found in the 'rdatafiles' folder.

Three categories of data were collected: demographic data, climate data, and water consumption data. The demogrpahic data (folder: 'DemographicData') were obtained from the US Census Bureau. The climate data (folder: 'ClimateData') were obtained from the PRISM Climate Group. The water consumption data (folder: 'WaterData') were obtained directly from the local water utility. All data were collected in 2019.
